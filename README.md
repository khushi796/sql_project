# SQL_PizzaSalesAnalysis
In this SQL project, I analyzed pizza sales data from Ws Cube Tech using four tables: orders, order_details, pizza_types, and pizzas. I imported Excel files into MySQL Server, cleaned the data, and established table relationships. Using SQL queries with joins, aggregations, and grouping, I extracted insights on top-selling pizzas, revenue contributions, order patterns, and overall sales trends.
